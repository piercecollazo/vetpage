            <p>This is an early work in progress of a site which will help veterans and servicemembers in the process of seperation from the armed forces in finding the resources and guidance they need to reintegrate into civilian life and build a fulfilling life, channeling the energy, dedication, and adaptation they displayed in service into their own edification and growth in this new chapter of their lives!</p>
